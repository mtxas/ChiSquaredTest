\title{Visualize the Chi-Squared Test}
\usage{
visualize_chi_squared_test(var_1, var_2)
}
\arguments{
\item{var_1}{the column name of the first variable in the dataset.}

\item{var_2}{the column name of the second variable in the dataset.}
}
\value{
A plot that visualizes the result of the test.
}
\description{
This function conducts a Chi-squared test on the variables var_1 and var_2.
It does so by displaying two generated null distributions: one using a theoretical approximation
(shown by the continuous line) and another using resampling methods (shown by the bars). Finally,
it draws a vertical red line, representing the observed statistic of the test.

For resampling, the method "permute" is used, like in https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/infer/vignettes/chi_squared.html.
It is described as follows: "The randomization approach approximates the null distribution by permuting the response and explanatory variables,
so that each personâ€™s educational attainment is matched up with a random income from the sample in order to break up any association between the two."
